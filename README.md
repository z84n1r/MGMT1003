Research-Led   Teaching
This course takes on an innovative hybrid delivery approach where students will engage in   learning through materials available on Wattle and live seminars (combination of both Lecture and   Tutorial). This course draws on and teaches models and frameworks based on empirical research         in management theory and organisational   behaviour and as such, takes an evidence-based   approach to management. The assessments in the course requires students to engage in analytic   and critical thinking   and the application of the models and   frameworks to observational data.
Further, students will be provided   with the opportunity to develop research literacy through the   use of examples and discussion of research design and methodology relevant to the discipline.
The course convener has a practical experience in all topics covered in the course and   will   incorporate discussion of this experience into the seminars, which include tutorial activities that   will also be guided by research findings in the discipline and positively allow students to   experience managerial training as well.
